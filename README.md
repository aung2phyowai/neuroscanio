# neuroscanio
Import .CNT, .EEG Neuroscan binary files as well as Neuroscan epoch file (.DAT) and Neuroscan event files (.EV2) into EEGLAB. There are also functions to import Neuroscan ASCII (text) location files from the command line as well as a beta function to export continuous CNT files from the command line.	

Version 1.2 update
- pop_writeeeg.m was removed (it was a mistake to include it in the first place as it is designed to export BDF files)
